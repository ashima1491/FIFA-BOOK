FIFA Book v0.2

**************************************************************************
SUMMARY
**************************************************************************
What is life without Goals? Well, we meant soccer goals. With thousands of players from hundreds of clubs around, whom to include in your playing squad can be quite a Messi (messy) affair. With FIFA Book, we aim to develop a tool that lets you move beyond your intuition and presents you with facts, numbers and statistics to help you finalize your playing eleven. The tool has an in-built algorithm which analyzes skills data from over 17k player records, and suggest the best team to play against your opponent. If you login to FIFA Book, you could see a player's profile and career graphs based on historic performances across clubs. If you are a soccer player and want to improve your skills, why not login to the system and let the tool identify your weak areas? The intended tool would recommend a workout and training routine to strengthen your weak spots and boost your performance. Further implementation would include creating a coaching schedule, maintaining a performance index for a group of new and emerging players and determining popularity of players on social media (popularity index).
